## Algorithms that dictates what you see

Social media are not designed for showing you the latest and most important
news, but for showing you content dictated by an algorithm.

And this content is normally viral, and viral doesn't mean .

Usually this algorithm prioritizes content that may get you angry.

Content that promotes negativity gets more clicks rather than those whose
promotes positivity.

That's the reason why Twitter and Facebook are full of stupid and irrelevant
posts (usually).

Of course, it's really cool when the algorithm shows you content that you like,
discovering new people and pages, but that's not usual.

Adding the annoying ads and more stuff that wants you to click it.

Meta (previously Facebook) nows about this, and encourgages it in their products
like Instagram and Facebook, the same for Twitter.

## News Aggregators or RSS

RSS is an acronym for "Really Simple Syndication".

It is an ancient technology, not promoted so much by companies.

That's because when you read a post in an RSS Reader, you don't need to visit
the website, and the website can't show advertisements using Google Ads (for
example). You don't generate traffic; your visits don't count, at least not if
you don't open the post link in your Aggregator Reader.

Not only that, but almost every RSS Reader shows you content sorted by date, not
by a complex and creepy algorithm that wants you to be mad.
