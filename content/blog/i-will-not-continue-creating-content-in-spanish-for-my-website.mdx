I had the idea of maintaining my website in both English and Spanish; however, that is giving me some trouble, like taking more time to create content.

That's why I have decided to only create content in English for now and in the future.

It doesn't mean that I reject my mother tongue or something like that, but just practicality.

I'll try to update the links to my posts shared on social media, as this website will be just juancman.dev/blog instead of juancman.dev/[locale]/blog.

However, if you want to contact me in Spanish, feel free to do it.
