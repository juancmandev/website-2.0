# About

This website was first created as a portfolio, but learning about how the
personal website is the digital form of the house tree, I like the idea of going
that way instead of a generic landing with my social media.

I'm trying to expand my skills, as I'm a Frontend Developer (with knowledge on
Backend), but skills like writing are important.

This website is in English to reach more people and put it into practice, but
Spanish is my mother tongue.

All content written here is without AI; I don't use it for generating ideas; the
only exception is [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/) for validating my
grammar.
