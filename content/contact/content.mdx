# Contact

You can contact me if:

- You want me to work
- Just say hello

Please consider that **I don't**:

- Work for free
- Work on your startup idea and just get equity in return (I can't pay my bills with lottery tickets)
- Work for you and get "exposure" (I can't pay my bills with exposure)
- Communicate via phone number; all communication must be via email (we can use Discord, Slack, etc. once you hire me).

## My email

Just change `[dot]` for `.` and `[arroba]` for `@`. This is for preventing web crawlers from getting my email:
