# Contact

You can contact me if:

- You want me to work
- Just say hello

These are my conditions for working:

- You must send me why you are contacting me; I'll not answer you if your email is like, "Hey juancmandev, contact me." You must tell me which project I would work on
- You must send me your **salary range**
- Max. 40 hours/per week as a full-time employee, 20 hours/per week as a freelancer

It's important that you send me your salary range for the position, you must have one; if you don't have one, then I can give you **consultancy**. $30 USD/30 minutes

If you want consulting:

- Schedule the meeting using **Google Meet**
- Try to write first your idea or question and the points you want to clarify before the meeting, so we can use those 30 minutes efficiently

Please consider that **I don't**:

- Work for free
- Work on your startup idea and just get equity in return (I can't pay my bills with lottery tickets)
- Work for you and get "exposure" (I can't pay my bills with exposure)
- Communicate via phone number; all communication must be via email (we can use Discord, Slack, etc. if you hire me).

## My email

Just change `[dot]` for `.` and `[arroba]` for `@`. This is for preventing web crawlers from getting my email:
