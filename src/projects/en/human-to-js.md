## Background

I’m always looking to grow my career by learning new technologies as well known Software Engineer; however, that could be dangerous because Software Engineer is not about using the ultimate tech stack but making things happen.

## Inspiration source

I was checking Twitter until I found a tweet where a person created a side project over a weekend. That project is a Human to SQL Translator, a simple UI to put text input describing a query; then you get the query into SQL, simple!

[@whoiskatrin](https://twitter.com/whoiskatrin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1634973237829599233%7Ctwgr%5Eb49b9d28e6ea7383ef16ea3c8c6040656ff0c944%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fwhoiskatrin2Fstatus2F1634973237829599233widget%3DTweet) used ChatGPT API to send a prompt typed by the user, and then show SQL response into a component to copy to the clipboard. That was enough to get the deserved attention of the community.

## My idea

> _“Why not a web app to type a prompt to generate JavaScript code?”_

That day I worked all day on this little project. Using the repo of Human to SQL Translator to guide me on how to communicate to ChatGPT API. I got it, a simple side project that solves a simple problem!

## Added value

Yes, there’re options like GitHub Copilot that resolve that problem, that’s why I added a select option to choose if the syntax should be an arrow function or a simple function.

I’ll add more features, like a TypeScript option, and use a TS Interface to use as a reference, but now I’m working on more projects!

## Inspiring people!

The cool thing about side projects is that inspires people like us, we can use our tech skill that serves the bread on the table to transform ideas into products, and products into a community, as [@Serudda](https://twitter.com/serudda) talks in this video (video audio in Spanish).
