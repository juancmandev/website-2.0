## The idea

You hear the ice cream man in his truck, you try to catch him, but the guy is already far away.

Why not get a notification on your phone when the ice cream man is near you? So you can just tap the notification and request the ice cream man to go to your location.

That's the purpose of this app.

## Overwhelming for me

I'd never developed a big app just by myself, but I want to try and see what happens.

I want to follow the Indie Hacker way, sharing in public the progress, and getting feedback from the community.

This post is the first step before designing in Figma or even creating the landing page, so I want to hear if you're interested, why you're not, or what would be great for the app.

## Starting small

I really want to start small, launching a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), with the next features:

- User registration and login
- Two types of users, peddlers and customers
- Peddlers
  - If the user is a peddler (wants to sell), redirect to the peddler form
  - Peddlers can create a profile with the name of their company and products that offer, for example ice cream, candy, etc
  - Once the registration is finished, peddlers can start routes
  - The app gets the location of the peddler, showing it on a map
  - The backend will detect if the peddler enters a radius of a customer, and send a push notification to the customer
  - Once the peddler has a request, the app will show the location of the requesting customer on the map
  - The peddler can go to the destination, and fulfill the transaction
- Customers
  - Customers can just create a profile with their name or alias, and set locations, for example: house
  - Once a peddler is near, the backend will send a notification to the customer
  - If the customer taps and confirms the notification

Of course, customers would change notifications settings and more, but that's the core idea.

For the MVP I don't want to implement in-app payments, but of course, it could be a future feature.
