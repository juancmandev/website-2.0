# Resources

Here you can find websites, YouTube channels, courses and more stuff that I consume or find interesting.

_Note: The content I consume could be in **English** or **Spanish**._

## Inspiration and Learning

### Websites

Inspiration sources, people who writtes things that I use to meditate and forge my own conclusions.

- [Eric Murphy](https://ericmurphy.xyz/) - The guy who inspired me to retake this side project and create more content
- [Bikobatanari](https://www.bikobatanari.art/) - Super original, fun and source of inspiration

### YouTube Channels

- [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA) - I really love short and direct informative videos

## Entertainment

### Books

I'm trying to be a regular reader.

- **El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quijote de la Mancha by _Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra_** - A classic of Spanish literature (2nd part yet to read)

- **White Fang by _Jack London_** - My favorite book of my infancy

- **The Call of the Wild by _Jack London_** - Not good as White Fang, but I like it too

- **Ready Player One by _Ernest Cline_** - We're already in this reality but boring (we're far away from having an OASIS)

- **War of the Worlds by _H. G. Wells_** - I was amazed how a book of this era could describe things so sci-fi

## Videogames

My favorite hobby, as you could imagine.

- **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** - A master class of open world design

- **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** - A master class of sandbox design

- **Dark Souls (I & III)** - No matter if the world is fucked, the difference is on you

- **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice** - As I don't consume drugs I prefer to play highly challenging games like this, it really makes me enter in _The Zone_

- **Elden Ring** I don't know what's really happening, I just want to slay Gods with my Claymore (the Lore is really cool actually)

- **Armored Core VI** - I discovered that I like mechas!

- **Metal Gear Rising** - Phylosophy, Hack 'n Slash and... _Nanomachines Son_
