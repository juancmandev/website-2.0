- **White Fang by _Jack London_** - My favorite book of my infancy

- **The Call of the Wild by _Jack London_** - Not good as White Fang, but I like it too

- **Ready Player One by _Ernest Cline_** - We're already in this reality but boring (we're far away from having an OASIS)

- **War of the Worlds by _H. G. Wells_** - I was amazed how a book of this era could describe things so sci-fi

### Videogames

My favorite hobby, as you could imagine.

- **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** - A master class of open world design

- **The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom** - A master class of sandbox design

- **Dark Souls (I & III)** - No matter if the world is fucked, the difference is on you

- **Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice** - As I don't consume drugs I prefer to play highly challenging games like this, it really makes me enter in _The Zone_

- **Elden Ring** - I don't know what's really happening, I just want to slay Gods with my Claymore (the Lore is really cool tho)

- **Armored Core VI** - I discovered that I like mechas!

- **Metal Gear Rising** - Phylosophy, Hack 'n Slash and... _Nanomachines son!_
