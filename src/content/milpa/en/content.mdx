Welcome to my Milpa, something like a garden; but instead of growing crops, I grow my thoughts.

Section inspired by the [garden of bikobatanari](https://www.bikobatanari.art/garden).

I'll try update this when I want, but the main purpose is to avoid using Twitter or other social media, and maybe save some cool sentences that I could found in my life, so it could be considered as a block notes too.
